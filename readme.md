![TelegramTask](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JackB1ack/telegram-notification/master/Screenshots/main.PNG)
Telegram Notification task uses [Telegraf - Telegram Bot Framework for Node.js](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) and allows you to send customizable notifications to your Telegram chats and groups.
This task has some predefined options of what info (e.g build/release status, ID etc.) to include in the message about your build/release process.

# Getting started

Only three steps to start receiving your notifications:
**1. Create a Bot**
**2. Get Chat Ids**
**3. Customize your notifications**

Follow the instructions below to configure the Telegram Notifications task to send messages to a group or chat.

## Create a Bot
First of all, you need to create a Telegram bot which will later send all the notifications to your chats.

* **Talk to Bot Father**: follow [Bot Father's](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) instructions and create a bot
* **Save Bot Token**: this token will be used by the task

* **Add your bot to every chat you want to be notified**

*Having a bot allows you to fully customize its appearance (nickname, user picture) and add it to as many chats or groups as you want.*

## Obtain chat IDs
Currently, Telegram doesn't offer a convenient way to obtain all chat IDs from bot API. 
So there are two ways to do it:

### 1. Add  [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to your group

Upon joining it will send a JSON where your chat ID will be located at message.chat.id.

**Don't forget to remove the bot from chat right after.**

### 2. Use built-in "Get chat ID" feature (*Preview*)

If you want the bot to send notifications directly to you (not a group), the trick with [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) won't work. You need to:

* **Check "Get chat Id" in task properties**

* **Queue build or release**: please make sure that this action won't affect any of your production processes. I suggest creating empty build\release definition just to get chat ID and then paste them into the real task.
* **Type /chat**: while the task is running use */chat* command in every chat where your bot is present

* **Type /stop**: use this command to finish task execution
* **Paste your chat IDs to task properties**: copy all your IDs to task property (use comma as delimiter *e.g -123456678,321654987*)

## Customize your message

There are some basic predefined features both for build and release tasks.

**General**

* **Add task status** - shows whether the task finished *successfully*, *failed* or *has some issues*.

*In order this to work properly, don't forget to change run conditions of the task to "Even if a previous task has failed"*

* **Add project link** - adds a link to your team project 
* **Message** - add a custom message to your notification. You can use [html markup](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style). Use \n or %0A for line breaks.

**For Release**

* **Name** - The name of the current release.
* **Created by** - The display name of identity that triggered the release.

**For Build**

* **Number** - The name of the completed build.
* **Queued by** - The display name of identity that queued the build.

*NOTE: USE EITHER RELEASE OR BUILD RELATED OPTIONS DEPENDING ON YOUR PROCESS*
